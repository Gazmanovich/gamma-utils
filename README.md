This is a gamma utility mod that should greatly benefit all players, making it much easier to see in the dark. 
It's a really basic mod that allows you to change the gamma value in game way higher than the in game brightness setting allows. 
Nights will look like day and caves will look like they're fully lit up.  
Basically Gammabright but for fabric.

## **Functions**

**Toggle Gamma**  
*Usage: Keybind (default: G)*  
Toggle between the default gamma percentage and the set toggled percentage.

**Increase Gamma**  
*Usage: Keybind (default: arrow up)*  
Increase the gamma percentage by the set step percentage.

**Decrease Gamma**  
*Usage: Keybind (default: arrow down)*  
Decrease the gamma percentage by the set step percentage.

## **Configuration (File / Mod Menu)**
